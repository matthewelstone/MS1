  ### Design

I wanted the design of the website to fit in with many of the bands existing promotional material.Using colors and fonts to compliment them. I wanted each page to be easy to navigate and to work semelessly with each other using the same colour combinations but in slightly different formats. 

- ### Colour scheme

  - I Picked the colour scheme by using a digital colour meter on the background of the Main image of the Index page.  I then entered that colour (#c6ced3) into the Adobe color wheel on the split complimentary setting.

- ### Typography
  - I only used one font throughout the website which is Quicksand from Google Fonts with a backup font of sans-serif if for some reason Quicksand doesnt load. I chose quicksand for the site because it is a complimentary font to the bands logos font with it looking quite similar but is easier to read in larger blocks of text. 

- ### Imigary
  - All of the images that I used were sent to be by the band and were used to enhance the visual aspect of the page. 

- ### Wireframes

I made all of my wireframes using Balsamiq. Making one for each page showing how the page would change for each screen size.

For the most part I kept the design of the website very similar to the wireframes only makeing a few changes.  Changing how many of the images for the shop you are able to see at the different breakpoints and also changing how many of the videos you can see at the different breakpoints. 

## Features
### Current Features
- Responsive on all device sizes.
- Accessable. 
- Social links for the band.
- Ticket links for the band.
- Embedded code from YouTube linking you to the bands videos.
- Contact information for the band when clicked will open up an email.

### Features which i want to implement in the future
- A webshop built into the website instead of sending you to another site.
- Interactive maps so that you can see more clearly where the band are playing.
- Fans being able to send in their own pictures of the band which can then be added to the gallery.
- Being able to book tickets directly from the site rather than the site sending you to ticketmaster.

### Technologies Used

5. [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/)
Gitpod was the text editor that I used to write the HTML and CSS in up untill its latest update. When it updated I found that the changes I made to the code took too long to apply to the site.

## Testing 

### HTML and CSS Testing
- HTML and CSS 
Mostly my HTML was okay and it only came up with a few problems.  I had buttons on two of the pages which were siblings of anchor tags. I fixed these by giving the anchor tags classes which were the same as the buttons and deleating the buttons.
The YouTube links that I have embedded in the index.html page also failed as they had inline styling. I fixed this by giving them a class and styling them there. 
The last thing was my form.  Emmet had given it an empty action attribute and as the form will not actually be posting anywhere I got rid of that.

My CSS was also mostly fine. I only needed to get rid of a couple of lines of code which weren't correct.
