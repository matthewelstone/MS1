  ### Design

I wanted the design of the website to fit in with many of the bands existing promotional material.Using colors and fonts to compliment them. I wanted each page to be easy to navigate and to work semelessly with each other using the same colour combinations but in slightly different formats. 

- ### Colour scheme

  - I Picked the colour scheme by using a digital colour meter on the background of the Main image of the Index page.  I then entered that colour (#c6ced3) into the Adobe color wheel on the split complimentary setting. 

<img src="assets/readmeimages/Colour-Palette.png" width="600" height="100">

- ### Typography
  - I only used one font throughout the website which is Quicksand from Google Fonts with a backup font of sans-serif if for some reason Quicksand doesnt load. I chose quicksand for the site because it is a complimentary font to the bands logos font with it looking quite similar but is easier to read in larger blocks of text. 

- ### Imigary
  - All of the images that I used were sent to be by the band and were used to enhance the visual aspect of the page. 

- ### Wireframes

I made all of my wireframes using Balsamiq. Making one for each page showing how the page would change for each screen size.

<img src="assets/readmeimages/tickets.png" width="700" height="350">

For the most part I kept the design of the website very similar to the wireframes only makeing a few changes.  Changing how many of the images for the shop you are able to see at the different breakpoints and also changing how many of the videos you can see at the different breakpoints. 

## Features
### Current Features
- Responsive on all device sizes.
- Accessable. 
- Social links for the band.
- Ticket links for the band.
- Embedded code from YouTube linking you to the bands videos.
- Contact information for the band when clicked will open up an email. 
- Links sending you to the bands webshop. 
### Features which i want to implement in the future
- A webshop built into the website instead of sending you to another site.
- Interactive maps so that you can see more clearly where the band are playing.
- Fans being able to send in their own pictures of the band which can then be added to the gallery.
- Being able to book tickets directly from the site rather than the site sending you to ticketmaster.

### Lighthouse Testing

Lighthouse testing seemed to vary quite a lot depending on the time of day. I think this may be to do with the internet conection that I have isn't the most reliable and can change drastically. On most of the pages I got quite good performance scores.

<img src="assets/readmeimages/performance-scores.png" height="75px" width="150px">

However Some of the images that I am using are too big.  I have tried to reduce the size of these images and they arent getting any smaller.  These were huge pictures which I recieved from the band but right now I dont think I have the knowledge to make them smaller and improve the score.  

### HTML and CSS Testing

- HTML and CSS 
To test my HTML I used the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)
Mostly my HTML was okay and it only came up with a few problems.  I had buttons on two of the pages which were siblings of anchor tags. I fixed these by giving the anchor tags classes which were the same as the buttons and deleating the buttons.
The YouTube links that I have embedded in the index.html page also failed as they had inline styling. I fixed this by giving them a class and styling them there. 
The last thing was my form.  Emmet had given it an empty action attribute and as the form will not actually be posting anywhere I got rid of that. 

<img src="assets/readmeimages/index-validation.png" width="700" height="300">
<img src="assets/readmeimages/about-validation.png" width="700" height="300">
<img src="assets/readmeimages/gallery-validation.png" width="700" height="300">
<img src="assets/readmeimages/tickets-validation.png" width="700" height="300">

To test my CSS I used the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator)
My CSS was also mostly fine. I only needed to get rid of a couple of lines of code which weren't correct.

### Known Bugs

- There is a slight overflow problem on the index page where there is about 15px of empty space on the right.  I believe that this is caused by the div containig the second embedded youtube video. 
I have tried applying overflow:hidden to several different elements but it hasn't worked. 

- There is the lighthouse performance which I mentioned above.  The pictures that I am using are too big and the file size needs to be much smaller.  

### Deployment

- Creation

I first created this repository by doing the following.

1. Logging into GitHub and clicking the green New button in the top right corner of the screen.
